The starting point for our tinkering.

Don't forget to run

```bash
npm install
```

after pulling down the code, running this command will install all of your necessary dependencies.  As we make changes you may need to run this again over time.

In order to run the server, you can run

```bash
npm run nodemon
```

and the server will start and will auto-update every time you make a change and save it.  This will let you just edit your code and use the web browser to interact with your site without having to relaunch the server again and again.


Happy hunting, see you on Wednesday.
